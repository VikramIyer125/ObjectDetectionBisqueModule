# ObjectDetectionBisqueModule
This is a BisQue Module that detects objects in images. 
It was made to test the BisQue Module developer found at https://github.com/UCSB-VRL/BQ_module_generator. 

Steps to run this module are as follows. 

1. Have a Directory structure as shown below, with a Modules folder, and each module as a subfolder within the Modules folder. In my case, the module is called EdgeDetection.
